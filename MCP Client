🤖 MCP Client Development
In this lab, you'll learn to build Python clients that interact with MCP servers programmatically. Move beyond the Inspector to create custom automation and integration solutions.

What you'll build:

Basic connection clients for server discovery
Tool execution clients for automation
Advanced clients with roots, sampling, and elicitation
Production-ready integration patterns
🌐 Cloud Environment: You'll develop Python clients and connect them to MCP servers via HTTP transport.

MCP client - > programaticaly connect to mcp server

Which Python package provides the official MCP client implementation?
The official MCP Python SDK is installed with 'mcp[client]' which includes the client-side components including ClientSession, transport implementations, and type definitions.

====

Step 1: Start the MCP Server

Before we can test MCP clients, we need to start the flight booking server that our clients will connect to.

Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory
Start the MCP server using the MCP CLI with streamable-http transport
Verify the server is running on port 8000
Leave this terminal open - the server must keep running
Commands to run:

cd /home/lab-user/flight-booking-server
uv run mcp run server.py --transport streamable-http

⚠️ Important:

Server runs on 127.0.0.1:8000 (MCP CLI default)
You should see "Server running on 127.0.0.1:8000" when server starts
All clients are configured to connect to http://localhost:8000/mcp/
Keep this terminal open throughout the lab!

Server Resource Discovery

Run the basic client to discover what resources the flight booking server provides. The server offers multiple resources that clients can access.

🔍 Discovery Task:

Open a new terminal (keep the server terminal running!)
Navigate to the mcp-client project directory
Run the basic client to see all available resources
Identify the additional resource beyond the airports data
Command to run:

cd /home/lab-user/mcp-client
uv run python basic_client.py

💡 Look for the "Available Resources" section in the output!

solution:

When you run the basic client with cd /home/lab-user/mcp-client && uv run python basic_client.py, it will discover and display all server resources.

The flight booking server provides two resources:

file://airports/ - Airport information and data
file://airlines/ - Airline information including names, countries, and fleet sizes
The basic client demonstrates how MCP clients can automatically discover server capabilities through the initialization process.

Tool Parameter Analysis

Examine the tools_client.py file to understand how MCP clients call server tools with specific parameters.

📋 Analysis Task:

Open and examine the file: /home/lab-user/mcp-client/tools_client.py
Look at the search_flights tool call in Test 1
Identify the destination airport parameter value
Optionally run the client to see the tools in action
🔍 Code Location:

flight_result = await client.call_tool("search_flights", {
    "origin": "LAX",
    "destination": "???"
})

Command to test:

cd /home/lab-user/mcp-client
uv run python tools_client.py

💡 Find the destination airport code used in the search_flights tool call!

solution

In tools_client.py, the search_flights tool is called with these parameters:

flight_result = await client.call_tool("search_flights", {
    "origin": "LAX",
    "destination": "JFK"
})
The destination parameter is set to "JFK" (John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York), while the origin is "LAX" (Los Angeles International Airport).
